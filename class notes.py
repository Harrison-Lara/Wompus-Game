## bottom left corner will be 0,0, player spawns there to start
## the grid will be 25 cells (5x5) or 0-4 on the x and y axis
## wompus and gold spawns on one cell and doesnt move
## 5 of the cells will be pits
## Gold can be in a pit, never reachable gold
## pit and wompus can be in the same cell but the wompus is greater than the pit
## adjacent to wompus - smell stench
## same cell as the gold - see a glint (grab gold)
## user tries to go off of grid- player feels a bump
## player has one arrow to shoot and will go across all of the cells in that direction
## score is always zero if you die
## minus score for shooting arrow and each move is a point deduction
## use classes and functions given in the pdf
## self.haswompus, etc should all be under the init(self) and booleans
## return true if on grid, off grid will return false
## just write the code for each class under class given
## no need to make any more classes
## can use an int or a string with direction to go a certain way
## should have 2 outsource files with the other classes
## import the two other files
## output that it is dark each time unless other
## greet user and tell them their commands
## climb out is at 0,0
## import (name of file)
